# Clan Rowthorn

Clan Rowthorn are shaped by the sea — and by what it has taken from them. Cities swallowed by tides and storms have left their culture wary of ancient powers and unforgiving of arrogance.

Aligned with Pelagos, Rowthorn doctrine values restraint, sealing, and burial. Dangerous forces are not to be studied or awakened, only contained or ended. Memory is sacred because it warns.

To Rowthorn, the Heartwood is not a mystery — it is a mistake waiting to repeat itself.
