# Clan Bacca

Clan Bacca rule the Midland Province, a harsh and mountainous region surrounded entirely by rival territories. Centuries of isolation forged a culture of self-reliance, martial discipline, and unshakeable loyalty to kin. Where other clans debate doctrine, Bacca trust steel, stone, and memory.

Though aligned with Telluria, their faith is not scholarly or reverent. The earth is respected as something to be stood upon and defended, not communed with. Strength, to Bacca, is a form of worship.

Their fortresses are old, their traditions older, and their people are raised to endure rather than question.
