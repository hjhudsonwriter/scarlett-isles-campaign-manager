# Clan Blackstone

Clan Blackstone are the long-standing stewards of Nightwood and its surrounding forest. Their rule predates the dominance of the Triarchic Temples and is founded not on conquest or faith, but on responsibility. To Blackstone, the forest is not an enemy to be burned nor a god to be worshipped — it is something to be *managed*.

Centuries ago, Clan Blackstone worked alongside Tellurian adepts and Stoneborn masons to stabilise what lay beneath Nightwood. The forest was never meant to be imprisoned, only soothed and guided. Over generations, much of this history was deliberately erased from clan records, leaving behind customs and fears whose origins few now remember.

Today, Blackstone leadership fears reckless intervention above all else. Fire, fanaticism, and haste have doomed cities before — and Nightwood sits directly atop the consequences of such mistakes.
