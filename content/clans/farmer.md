# Clan Farmer

Clan Farmer are the most devout followers of Aurush in the Scarlett Isles. To them, ancient forces that resist order are not sacred — they are threats. Fire is mercy. Delay is heresy.

They believe the world must be kept clean, even if that requires destruction. Compassion lies in ending corruption swiftly, before it spreads.

To Clan Farmer, the Heartwood is an abomination that should never have been allowed to sleep.
