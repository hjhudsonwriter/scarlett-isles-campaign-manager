# Clan Slade

Clan Slade rule the open plains and rolling valleys of the Eastern Province. They are watchers, brokers, and record-keepers, known for avoiding entanglement until action becomes unavoidable.

Their Tellurian faith emphasises patience, cycles, and inevitability. Where other clans rush to act, Slade observe, prepare, and wait. Neutrality is not cowardice — it is strategy.

Many conflicts across the Isles have ended because Clan Slade chose the moment to intervene.
