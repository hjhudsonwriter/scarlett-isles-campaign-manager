# Clan Karr

Clan Karr hail from the frost-bitten North Isle, where survival is earned daily. Life is brutal, resources are scarce, and deception is despised. The Karr respect only strength, honesty, and action.

Their Pelagos faith is raw and elemental. The sea takes what it will, without apology. So must people.

Karr warriors raid not for cruelty, but necessity — and they speak truths others refuse to voice.
