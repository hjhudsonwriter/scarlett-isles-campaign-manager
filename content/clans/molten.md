# Clan Molten

Clan Molten are the economic engine of the Scarlett Isles. Their southern cities are wealthy, sprawling, and cosmopolitan, built on trade routes, shipping lanes, and carefully brokered alliances. Coin, not faith, is their primary instrument of power.

Though culturally aligned with Aurush, Molten devotion is pragmatic rather than zealous. Fire is a tool of industry, progress, and transformation — not divine judgement. Temples are funded, not obeyed.

Where others wage war or prayer, Clan Molten invests.
