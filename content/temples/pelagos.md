# Temple Pelagos

Pelagos temples are heavy, low-built structures carved into stone or built near water. Silence, weight, and humility define their spaces. Rituals focus on burial, sealing, and remembrance.

Pelagos teaches inevitability. The sea does not argue, and neither should mortals when faced with forces beyond them. Survival comes from restraint, not mastery.
