# Temple Telluria

The Temple of Telluria is built as much downward as it is upward. Stone pillars are deliberately entwined with living roots, and the air within is heavy, cool, and unnervingly still. Unlike the rest of Nightwood, the deep hum of the forest does not echo here.

Beneath the visible temple lies an altar far older than the structure above it, carved with ancient glyphs that predate the Triarchy itself. These markings were never prayers — they were stabilisers. Lullabies etched into stone, meant to calm something wounded beneath the earth.

Tellurian doctrine teaches that the land endures pain silently until it can no longer bear it. The earth does not scream — it *remembers*. And when it finally moves, it does so with purpose.
