# Temple Aurush

The Temple of Aurush is bright, open, and deliberately hostile to shadow. White stone courtyards reflect sunlight, and fire rituals dominate worship. Flame is truth made visible.

Aurushi doctrine teaches that corruption thrives in darkness and hesitation. What cannot survive cleansing should not endure. Fire reveals, refines, and ends suffering quickly.
